TEASER
FADE IN:
1 INT. HOME -- MORNING (DAY 1) 1
Very basic. A few personal touches but not many: several
Rubik's cubes, a few photographs and lots and lots of books.
And as we are seeing various SHOTS of this home, we will
also see SHOTS of SHAUN MURPHY, 25, awkward at the best of
times, brushing his teeth and brushing his teeth and brushing
his teeth and then--
Brushing his hair; then--
Buttoning his shirt; then--
Brushing his hair again; then--
Packing a bag of clothes; everything perfectly folded and
arranged; then--
Brushing his hair yet again. It's absolutely perfect; then--
Finally, and incongruously, mussing his hair.
2 EXT. CASPER, WYOMING -- MORNING 2
A small city of about 50,000 with a rich cowboy, mining
history; a beautiful setting but it's seen better days (a
few abandoned or condemned buildings are evident). And we
aren't even in the heart of Casper. In the suburbs, if you
can call them that, where the flats of the city start climbing
into the mountains that make this place so scenic, we find
some working class homes.
And then a door opens. And out emerges Shaun with the rolling
suitcase and a smaller bag over his shoulder. He doesn't
lock up behind him; either he's very trusting or he's not
planning on coming back.
And he begins to walk down into town, pulling his case behind
him.
We have no idea what he's up to, where he's going or why.
But there is something odd about his gait. Like the motion
of his arms aren't completely connected to the motion of his
legs; he doesn't look up all that much either.
And he passes a field, at the edge of which sits a school
bus. He stops and looks at it. It apparently has some
significance to him. But he's quickly snapped out of his
reverie when--2.
A soccer ball rolls in front of him and some 12 year old
kids yell for him to return it. He looks at it for a long
time, like he's trying to figure out how it works or how to
address it. And we FLASH TO--
3 EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - FLASHBACK -- DAY 3
YOUNG SHAUN, 14, is on the ground being kicked and beaten by
other 14 year olds. Young Shaun is scared and in pain but he
has a weird grin on his face and he doesn't say anything. He
just stares off at something off camera.
Before we witness too much of this, we pan off Shaun to what
he has been looking at, a lone soccer ball sitting in the
field. We get the feeling this ball is somehow to blame for
what's happening.
And then, beyond the ball, we see a twelve year old boy
sprinting toward us. This is STEVE, Shaun's younger brother.
He runs right past the ball and into the melee. He doesn't
care that he's smaller than any of the other boys. He starts
pushing them and scratching them and yelling at them. Maybe
they could fight him off but he's so crazed and relentless
that the other boys back off.
Steve turns to his brother to see if he's okay. Shaun is
bleeding above his right eye.
4 EXT. FIELD - FLASHBACK -- DAY 4
Steve has gotten some ointment and bandages from home and is
tenderly taking care of Shaun's wounds as Shaun rocks, holding
onto his beloved pet rabbit.
STEVE
Hold still.
SHAUN
Okay.
But he keeps rocking.
STEVE
Those boys... They're not really
that bad.
The rocking stops. Shaun is surprised by the comment, isn't
sure how to react.
STEVE (CONT'D)
They could be your friends.
SHAUN
Why do I want them to be my friend?3.
STEVE
...Everybody needs friends, Shaun.
Shaun goes back to rocking.
5 EXT. CASPER, WYOMING -- DAY 5
Back to the present.
Shaun awkwardly kicks the ball back to the boys and walks
on.
AND THEN A MONTAGE of this odd man's travels.
6 EXT. WYOMING -- DAY 6
A bus out of town, through the mountains...
Shaun staring out the window (and away from human contact)...
The bus pulls into Cheyenne regional airport...
And finally...
7 INT. SAN JOSE AIRPORT -- DAY 7
Shaun, having just disembarked, stands there in the busy
airport. It's a far cry from where he came from. People hurry
past him. People working, people lining up, people eating,
sleeping, reading. Among them--
WORKERS install a hanging glass-covered commercial sign--
An eight year old boy (ADAM) watches them, fascinated--
His mother (BONNIE) has one eye on him as she buys candy at
a pharmacy--
Dad (CARL) is reading a magazine in a bookstore; not buying
it, just reading it.
People, people, people. And noise. The noise of the people,
the noise of the announcements, multiple simultaneous
announcements. So much sensory overload.
Shaun takes something from his pocket, unwraps it, and we
see a child's toy scalpel, dirty and worn. We don't know
what it means or why but it clearly means something.
After a beat, he wraps it up again and begins walking out...4.
SHAUN
(quietly to himself)
Twenty feet past the second Cinnabon,
turn right, twenty feet past the
second Cinnabon, turn right...
He has a system and he has things under control.
But of course the universe doesn't give a shit about his
system. SUDDENLY, one of the cables holding the sign SNAPS.
The glass SHATTERS and RAINS DOWN--
On Adam, the little boy. He falls to the ground, unconscious
and bleeding--
The world reacts. Mother screams and hurries to her son;
father also rushes to his side. The workers are horrified by
what they've done. Passers by are scared, unsure what to do;
someone calls 911--
Adam lies on the ground, blood flowing copiously from his
neck.
Shaun watches, apparently impassive.
A DOCTOR hurries to the unconscious child.
DOCTOR
I'm a doctor, let me take a look.
The mother lets him in and he quickly assesses the damage to
the neck--
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
His jugular artery has been cut.
Does anyone have a clean cloth?
The thing about crowds is everyone assumes the questions and
the obligations are always for someone else. No one is quite
sure how to react. And not sure if they even want to.
DOCTOR (CONT'D)
Please. Someone.
BONNIE
What do you mean? How clean? I have
a fresh change of clothes in my bag.
DOCTOR
Great. Perfect.
Bonnie quickly opens her carry on bag, removes one of her
son's t-shirts and hands it to the doctor who immediately
places it on the wound, almost instantly stanching the blood
flow. Bonnie and Carl are momentarily relieved, until--5.
SHAUN (O.S.)
You're killing him.
The doctor and others look up. What did he just say? Shaun
just stares back.
DOCTOR
I'm saving his life. He was bleeding
out.
SHAUN
You have it in the wrong place.
DOCTOR
(annoyed)
I think I remember enough of anatomy
101 to know where the jugular vein
is and--
SHAUN
You'd be in the right place if he
was an adult. He's not an adult.
Which means you're also putting
pressure on his trachea. Which means
he's not currently breathing.
The Doctor is momentarily stunned, looks down at Adam's chest.
Indeed, it's not rising and falling. Shit.
SHAUN (CONT'D)
You have to put the pressure higher
up.
And Shaun kneels down and does just that. And everyone looks
to the boy's chest, expectantly. After a beat, it starts to
rise and fall. The Doctor is embarrassed but also surprised
and grateful.
DOCTOR
Who are you?
SHAUN
I'm Shaun Murphy, I'm a surgeon at
San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.
Well that wasn't what the doctor (or our audience) expected.
And with his free hand, Shaun begins to check the body for
other damage; he notices something and lifts up the boy's
shirt, revealing a large piece of glass embedded in the boy's
stomach. Oh shit--

END TEASER6.
ACT ONE
FADE IN:
8 EXT. SAN JOSE ST. BONAVENTURE HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING -- DAY 8
9 INT. LECTURE HALL -- DAY 9
An amphitheater type lecture hall. But today it's being used
for a board meeting. The entire Board of Directors (20 of
them) is present. The four you need to know are: ALLEGRA
ALEXIS, 48, Vice President of the Foundation that controls
this hospital, perpetually calm and clever, it's clear from
the deference she receives in this room that she's a person
of power; JESSICA PRESTON, 35, Board Member, not a doctor,
carries some resentment because people usually dismiss her
as a rich kid, she's smarter than most of them give her credit
for and definitely way more astute; and HORACE ANDREWS, 42,
Head of Surgery, capable surgeon, defensive, doesn't always
think before he talks. And at the front is DR. IRA GLASSMAN,
60, President of the Hospital, a good man who wasn't always
a good man and is trying to make up for it. Right now, Dr.
Glassman is a little annoyed and defensive that this session
is taking place at all.
ANDREWS
Autism: A mental condition
characterized by difficulty in
communicating and using language and
abstract concepts. That's the
definition; does it sound like I'm
describing a surgeon?
GLASSMAN
He's not Rain Man. He's high
functioning; he's capable of living
on his own and managing his own
affairs.
ANDREWS
That's our new hiring standard? "High
functioning?"
GLASSMAN
The issue isn't 'our standards';
it's my standard. Is it seriously
necessary to hold a special meeting
of the Board of Directors just to
question one of my hiring decisions?
Did you bother to look up the
definition of "President" while you
were skimming the dictionary?7.
ANDREWS
--You're hiring him for surgery; my
department; over my objections.
It's growing heated. But--
ALEXIS
Gentlemen.
One word from her can shut down any argument. They turn to
her, deferential. She's polite and respectful in style but
her words can cut. She addresses Andrews first:
ALEXIS (CONT'D)
Horace, stop trying to make everything
personal. You don't like Dr. Glassman--
ANDREWS
I never said--
ALEXIS
Shhh. You've wanted his job from day
one. Everyone in this room knows
that.
(turning to Glassman)
And you, Ira... Yes, it's your
hospital. But the money to run it
comes from the Foundation I control.
So... let's play nice shall we? Stop
acting like you're stunned that you're
standing here. You tried to slip one
past us.
GLASSMAN
He finished medical school with
virtually straight A's. I personally
spoke to two of his professors; he's
more than qualified--
ALEXIS
And you genuinely thought this Board
wouldn't reasonably have a few doubts
about hiring a surgeon who has been
diagnosed with autism?
Glassman doesn't respond. He knows she's right.
ALEXIS (CONT'D)
So justify your decision.
She sits back. A beat, Dr. Glassman looks around the room,
they're all waiting, curious. Enough with the academic
justification; it's time to get a little personal...8.
GLASSMAN
I met Shaun Murphy when I was back
home in Wyoming a number of years
ago for Thanksgiving. He was fourteen
years old. He was, and still is, an
extraordinary young man. Yes, he
suffers from autism but there are,
at least in his case, blessings that
go with that as well. He has savant
syndrome; genius level skills in
several areas. He has almost perfect
recall and spatial intelligence.
(to Andrews, making
his case)
That is an undeniable benefit for
any doctor, particularly a surgeon,
wouldn't you agree?
And all eyes turn to Andrews:
ANDREWS
...You've known him since he was
fourteen?
Preston shakes her head, knows where this is going. Glassman
doesn't.
GLASSMAN
I mentored him, watched him grow;
I've seen first hand what he's capable
of. By the age of sixteen, Shaun had
memorized every part of the human
body and at least one complete medical
textbook.
ANDREWS
(making a point, gently)
You "mentored" him. You care about
him. He's like a son to you.
Glassman doesn't disagree. But...
PRESTON
Dr. Andrews, your wife isn't going
to be happy with you.
(off Andrews confusion)
If you're trying to turn this into a
nepotism case, we'll have to fire
her loser nephew from bookkeeping.
Some chuckles in the room. Not from Andrews; he shoots Preston
a nasty look.9.
10 INT. RESIDENTS' REST AREA -- DAY 10
A dark quiet room. After a moment, DR. ELLE MCLEAN, 30, smart,
confident, loyal, enters, flipping on the light--
JARED
Hey!
Apparently the room isn't empty. This is DR. JARED UNGER,
28, handsome, smart, a bit of a romantic, and basically
blinded by the sudden light. He's been sleeping on a top
bunk (there are several bunks in the room for hard working
residents and interns to take breaks in).
ELLE
Sorry. You seen Claire?
JARED
Turn out the damn light.
ELLE
(doesn't)
You seen Claire?
JARED
Why? Would you turn out the light?
ELLE
Melendez wants to operate on 104 but
Claire hasn't gotten informed consent.
And she's ignoring her page. You
seen her?
JARED
No. Go away and turn off the light.
Elle leaves, leaving the light on. Jared can't believe it.
JARED (CONT'D)
...She's such a bitch.
And we assume he was just muttering that to himself until:
CLAIRE (O.S.)
Nah. She just doesn't like you.
And we realize that CLAIRE BROWNE, 27, strong-willed, deeply
caring, and defiant to cover her insecurities, has been in
bed with Jared the whole time; between him and the wall. She
gets up and climbs over him, jumping down to get dressed.
And as she dresses:10.
CLAIRE (CONT'D)
Aren't we supposed to be getting a
new resident? Someone to get consents
while we sleep.
JARED
This is kind of silly, isn't it?
CLAIRE
Maybe. To say for sure, I'd need to
know what you're talking about.
JARED
Us.
CLAIRE
Not silly at all. Quite a bit of fun
actually.
JARED
I meant that we're hiding it. Our
relationship.
Claire looks at him. In her mind, they've had this discussion,
in one form or another, many times. In his mind, it's clearly
a little less clear. She gives him, unemotionally, the simple
truth.
CLAIRE
...We don't have a relationship,
Jared. We have sex. If you want to
tell people you're screwing me, go
for it.
She gives him a quick kiss and then exits. He tries to cover
just how not happy he is with the way that just went.
11 INT. AIRPORT -- DAY 11
The EMTs have not yet arrived and Shaun and the Doctor
continue to attend to the boy. Carefully bandaging wounds
and stabilizing shards of glass. In the midst of this,
concerned about something, Shaun glances at his watch.
But then Shaun stops, staring at the boy's right arm. Then
to the boy's left arm; then to the boy's chest. Then cycling
back and around again. Obsessively. The Mother notices.
MOTHER
Is everything okay?
SHAUN
The veins in the boy's right arm are
popping.11.
The Doctor takes a look. It's subtle. He's not sure he sees
anything.
DOCTOR
I don't know; I--
SHAUN
It's a symptom of increased
intrathoracic pressure.
And then we will get our first glimpse of a device we shall
frequently be using: Pop-Up Medicine. A card will appear on
the screen that will be an image from Shaun's memory.
Typically, but not always, it will be an image from a medical
textbook. It will always provide us with information about
his current medical thought processes.
POP-UP
Venous distension is caused by
increased intrathoracic pressure
inside the chest cavity.
[Where helpful, the Pop-Up will be accompanied by diagrams
or pictures - but scripts, by their nature, tend to be all
about words - for the highly motivated, feel free to scroll
around https://www.netterimages.com.]
The doctor looks to the boy's chest; sees no reason for
concern.
DOCTOR
His chest is rising; he's breathing.
SHAUN
Chest is moving paradoxically. The
right lung is in distress.
POP-UP
It is a rare sign of a life
threatening condition known as
traumatic pneumothorax.
SHAUN
This is a medical emergency.
POP-UP
Treatment is focused on correcting
the underlying cause of the finding.
SHAUN
(to anyone)
Who here has a sharp knife, blade
six inches or longer?12.
Their reactions are what you'd expect - this is an airport
after all... Shaun takes that in, then:
SHAUN (CONT'D)
(to Doctor)
You should start artificial
respiration. He's going to stop
breathing very soon.
And then Shaun gets up and quickly walks away. Huh?
12 INT. PATIENT ROOM 104 -- DAY 12
Claire patiently meets with 104 whom she, because she's a
decent person, calls by his name, CALLUM REILLY, 46. He's a
bit old fashioned, considers himself a man's man. His wife
and two teenage children are bedside.
CALLUM
I feel fine.
CLAIRE
That's great, Mr. Reilly. That's
what we want to hear but the angiogram
confirmed what the stress echo hinted
at: you need bypass surgery. Quite
urgently.
CALLUM
So you people keep telling me.
CLAIRE
Dr. Melendez is an excellent surgeon.
And bypass surgery has become almost
routine in the last ten years--
As she talks, Callum looks to his family, scoffs--
SON
You're telling us there's no risk?
CLAIRE
There's always a risk but--
DAUGHTER
We want a second opinion.
CLAIRE
There was no mistake made--
WIFE
Then you should have no issue with
getting a second opinion.13.
CLAIRE
Time is the issue. Dr. Melendez would
like to do the surgery today.
(to Callum, firm)
That doesn't give us time to get
another doctor in here to confirm
what you already know is true: you
need this surgery or you will die.
She hands him a clipboard.
CLAIRE (CONT'D)
Now please sign this consent.
Callum considers, then looks to his family.
CALLUM
No.
Claire takes a second, then turns to the wife and children.
CLAIRE
Would it be okay if I spoke to Callum
alone?
They look to him; he nods, they kiss him and leave. Then:
CLAIRE (CONT'D)
They're following your lead. They're
scared because you're scared.
CALLUM
I'm not scared.
CLAIRE
Then you're crazy.
(off his look)
We are going to cut your chest open;
we are going to stop your heart,
repair it and then restart it. Are
you seriously telling me that doesn't
scare you?
CALLUM
I just want a second opinion.
CLAIRE
Yesterday, your life was perfect;
playing tennis, having sex with your
wife; today you're lying in a hospital
bed trying to figure out the best
way to say goodbye to your teenage
children.14.
CALLUM
(fighting back tears)
Why are you doing this?
CLAIRE
(compassionate but
firm)
Because I can't deal with lies. If
you lie to me, my answers won't help
you.
Callum doesn't answer; won't make eye contact.
CLAIRE (CONT'D)
But if you're scared, I can help
you.
A long beat before...
CALLUM
I'm scared.
Claire nods.
13 INT. AIRPORT - TSA -- DAY 13
Shaun has not made a run for it. He's actually at the airport
security checkpoint. He walks behind the barrier to where
the SECURITY PERSONNEL work, heads for a large bin--
TSA OFFICER
(stern)
Excuse me. You can't be back here.
He grabs Shaun.
SHAUN
Where do you keep the knives that
people forget they're traveling with?
I need a knife.
TSA OFFICER
(sarcasm)
Oh sure. A knife; no problem. Anything
else? Fuse wire? Plastic explosives?
SHAUN
I also need a narrow six foot tube
and alcohol and baggage handling
tape but I'm going to get the alcohol
from the duty free store and the
tube from the back of a soda machine.15.
TSA OFFICER
(bit stunned but)
Well good luck with that. But you're
not getting a knife.
SHAUN
I need a sharp knife. It's quite
urgent. It's a medical emergency.
TSA OFFICER
You're not a doctor.
SHAUN
Yes I am.
Shaun sees a bin filled with contraband and starts to move
toward it, but the TSA Officer again stops him.
SHAUN (CONT'D)
That one. That's a good one right
near the top. It looks very sharp.
TSA OFFICER
Can I see some identification?
SHAUN
No. I don't--
TSA OFFICER
Then you're not getting a knife;
call 911 and get out of--
SHAUN
There's no time.
Shaun runs to the bin, grabs the knife and makes a run for
it.
But he's not a good runner and he doesn't get far. He's
tackled hard to the ground by three very large and adept TSA
Officers.
One of them grabs the knife, another pulls out handcuffs.
TSA OFFICER
You idiot; you're lucky we didn't
just shoot--
BONNIE (O.S.)
Please. No.
They look up and see the young boy's mother nearby.
BONNIE (CONT'D)
He's trying to save my son's life.16.
The TSA personnel look to each other - this isn't the type
of situation they're taught.
14 INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAYS -- DAY 14
Claire tracks down a busy DR. NEIL MELENDEZ, 35, incredibly
skilled surgeon and equally harsh boss (anything less than
perfection is unacceptable in surgery), and he happens to be
Claire's boss.
MELENDEZ
You get the consent on 104?
CLAIRE
I made him a deal. He's meeting with
Dr. Max from psychiatry at six,
we'll have the consent by eight, we
can operate first thing in the
morning.
If Claire was expecting a "good job"; that's not what she
gets.
MELENDEZ
Psychiatry? His problem's in his
heart, not his head. You did pass
anatomy, right Dr. Browne?
CLAIRE
He's not psychologically ready for
surgery. He will be. Soon.
MELENDEZ
He's physically ready. Get the
consent. They're prepping O.R. six
right now.
And Melendez starts to walk away. Claire follows.
CLAIRE
Do I need to cite you the seventeen
studies that show a correlation
between attitude and outcome for
surgical patients?
MELENDEZ
(strong, but calm)
You do know I'm your superior, right?
You do know what the opposite of
superior is?
CLAIRE
Subordinate; doesn't--17.
MELENDEZ
Sure. Subordinate. Or... inferior.
Either way.
CLAIRE
Doesn't mean I'm wrong.
MELENDEZ
I suppose not. Just means you have
to act like you're wrong.
He finally stops and looks at her; awaiting her answer to
the implicit question. Claire considers her options and...
CLAIRE
(one final plea)
He's panic stricken. Yesterday he
thought he was young and healthy;
today he's suddenly mortal. Just
give him a day to wrap his head around
that.
Melendez considers Claire for a beat. Then he looks beyond
her to Jared who stands nearby, trying to be unnoticed as he
listens in to the awkward conversation.
MELENDEZ
Dr. Unger? You think you can get me
a signed informed consent from 104?
Jared had no intention of throwing himself into the middle
of this but that's where he is. He looks from Melendez to
Claire, then back again and...
JARED
Of course.
Melendez takes the clipboard from Claire, hands it to Jared
and Melendez continues on... leaving Claire with Jared.
CLAIRE
...You think he's right?
JARED
I think he's my boss. And if I have
to choose between my boss and...
'the woman I'm screwing', not much
of a choice, am I right?
A look between them. And then he heads off to do his job,
leaving her alone--18.
15 INT. AIRPORT - ACCIDENT SCENE -- DAY 15
Shaun is once more with the boy. The crowd is still watching.
But among them now, right near the front, are two TSA
Officers, hovering close by, keeping an eye on Shaun, curious
and uncertain.
The Doctor continues to do A.R. on Adam whose skin is now an
unhealthy shade of blue, as Shaun finishes his own
preparations--
He sterilizes the knife and one end of a 1/4 inch diameter
tube using alcohol from a bottle of Jack Daniels--
He refills the empty whiskey bottle with water--
Places one end of the tube into the whiskey bottle--
Very neatly and methodically tapes the tube in place--
Then he picks up the knife and uses his fingers to find his
target on the child--
POP-UP
Tension pneumothorax is usually due
to a lung laceration which allows
air to escape into the pleural space
surrounding the lung but not to return
into the lung.
This information is accompanied by an image from an anatomy
textbook which includes among other things, the lungs and
the surrounding rib cage. We jump in closer and closer and...
SHAUN
Incision should take place two ribs
down.
And he cuts. And cuts. It's slightly crude but very targeted.
There's blood but not an inordinate amount.
POP-UP
Care must be taken not to harm the
vein, artery, and nerve which run
under the rib bone.
We hear a slight hiss.
Shaun feeds the tube in through the incision. And we see air
bubbles coming out and into the tube. They flow along the
tube and into the bottle where they are released into the
water...
DOCTOR
Why the bottle?19.
SHAUN
The air will continue to leak and
accumulate until the damage can be
properly repaired. The tube allows
the air to get out. The water in the
bottle stops the air from coming
back in.
The Doctor shakes his head, impressed.
DOCTOR
Hunh. A home made one way valve.
(then, excited)
His right chest is rising.
(takes a moment to
confirm)
He's breathing!
(even the doctor is
amazed)
You saved his life.
The crowd cheers. The relieved and grateful parents hug a
rather awkward Shaun - he doesn't like being hugged but is
even less comfortable saying no. Shaun is almost confused by
the outpouring of love.
FADE OUT:
END OF ACT ONE20.
ACT TWO
FADE IN:
16 INT. OUTSIDE LECTURE HALL -- DAY 16
The Board meeting has taken a recess. People mill about in
small groups.
Glassman is on his phone, waiting for an answer...
17 INT. AIRPORT - TSA -- AT THAT MOMENT 17
A ringing sound comes from the discarded items bin.
We find Shaun's bag there. Obviously, at an airport it
wouldn't just be sitting where he left it.
The phone continues to ring. Our TSA Officer glances over,
but goes about his business.
18 INT. OUTSIDE LECTURE HALL -- AT THAT MOMENT 18
Glassman leaves a message.
DR. GLASSMAN
Shaun, I hope you're okay. It's not
like you to be late... I really need
you here. Call me as soon as you
can.
Preston approaches Glassman; they're old friends and they
interact with the resultant comfort and casualness.
PRESTON
You're a political genius.
Glassman reacts, uncertain--
GLASSMAN
You're being sarcastic.
PRESTON
Very. This isn't about the new doctor;
it's about you. They're baiting you.
And you're letting them.
DR. GLASSMAN
They? So far it's just been Andrews,
that pompous ass.
PRESTON
And you think that "pompous ass"
would have the nerve to go after you
(MORE)21.
PRESTON (CONT'D)
if he didn't have other people backing
him up?
Glassman thinks about that - she's probably right.
PRESTON (CONT'D)
Here's how you win this. You do not
make it personal. You do not make it
about you. That's what they want and
soon as you give it to them, you
lose.
Glassman considers--
PRESTON (CONT'D)
You win this if you just don't
overplay your hand.
ELSEWHERE IN THE HALLWAY
And sure enough we find Andrews with Alexis.
ALEXIS
Just don't overplay your hand.
ANDREWS
(annoyed)
He's always been an arrogant jerk;
does whatever he wants, doesn't care
who gets hurt. Suddenly he's playing
the messiah; selling us that he's
all about humanity?!
ALEXIS
He might be on this one.
Andrews shoots her a look, a bit surprised.
ANDREWS
You should be angrier than I am;
he's destroying this hospital; we've
been bleeding money the last seven
quarters.
She doesn't disagree. But she's also calmer and more astute
than he is.
ALEXIS
And... there are people here who
love him; you don't become President
by crapping on someone they love.
Andrews is aggravated and frustrated.22.
ALEXIS (CONT'D)
Glassman cares about this place every
bit as much as you do. And he cares
about this young doctor.
(off Andrews)
And that's his weakness.
Andrews isn't sure he understands, but he trusts her.
19 INT. AMBULANCE (MOVING) -- DAY 19
It's crowded. Adam lies unconscious, still hooked up to the
tubes from the makeshift operation. Bonnie holds her son's
hand; Carl holds Bonnie's. An EMT monitors the boy's vital
signs. And Shaun sits awkwardly as far away as he can get,
looking at his hands in his lap.
SHAUN
I need to get to San Jose St.
Bonaventure Hospital.
EMT
That's where we're going.
Shaun takes a beat to process, then looks up and sees the
Mother as she tenderly holds her vulnerable child's hand and
the Father looking on with worried love.
Outwardly he doesn't react, but it triggers a memory.
20 INT. SHAUN'S CHILDHOOD HOME - FLASHBACK -- DAY 20
Close on Young Shaun, once again holding his pet rabbit,
seemingly unaffected by anything. We are in Shaun's world -
it's almost silent (except we continue to hear the beeping
of the heart monitor in the ambulance), then gradually sounds
start to permeate it; at first it's vague, then gradually
clearer; a voice, a loud voice, an angry yelling voice.
PULL OUT TO REVEAL that Shaun's mother, MARCIE, is at his
side. She loves him, wants to protect him, but has no idea
how. She also loves Shaun's father, but has even less idea
how to deal with him. She's not a strong woman, either
physically or emotionally. In front of them is Shaun's father,
ETHAN, the source of the yelling, and growing more and more
out of control by the moment. He's a man who wants to be a
man - but is simply out of his depth in so many areas of his
life.
ETHAN
How hard is it to just act like a
normal human being?!
MARCIE
He doesn't know how--23.
ETHAN
Bull! He knows how when he wants to
know how! And then he gets beat up
every day--
STEVE
That's not his fault.
And we notice Steve is there to, watching from a doorway.
ETHAN
Stay out of this, Steve. You're not
his parent. Aren't you tired of
getting beaten up with him?
STEVE
It's not his fault.
ETHAN
Go to bed.
Steve stares back, not moving--
ETHAN (CONT'D)
Go to bed!
Steve reluctantly leaves.
ETHAN (CONT'D)
(to Marcie)
What the hell are we supposed to
do?! This is the third school he's
been thrown out of.
MARCIE
We'll find another.
ETHAN
Nothing will change. They can't handle
him and I don't blame them; we
obviously can't handle him either.
(to Shaun)
What the hell happened this time?
Shaun doesn't respond, just keeps petting his rabbit--
ETHAN (CONT'D)
What happened?!
Still nothing. Ethan grabs Shaun by the chin, forcing him to
look his father in the eyes.
MARCIE
Don't do that.24.
ETHAN
What did you do?!
Still nothing. And out of frustration, Ethan slaps the boy.
MARCIE
No!
But she doesn't try to intervene. And Shawn still doesn't
react. He actually lets out a slight laugh--
ETHAN
You think that's funny? You want
funny?
And he hits his son, sending him flying. And then--
Steve comes charging into the room, tackling his father.
This time it's the father's turn to laugh. Steve is no match
for his father, he tosses the boy off.
Then he looks to the room: his scared wife, his defiant son,
and the son he has no idea how to deal with who has simply
gone back to petting his rabbit.
That damn rabbit.
Ethan picks up the rabbit and violently throws it across the
room. We don't see the result but we have little doubt.
Shaun looks on. There's no obvious reaction. But we know
he's heart broken. His brother comes to his side and holds
him as Shaun starts to rock.
And we hear the sound of the heart monitor as it becomes
slightly softer, not slower, just a little softer. [If we
don't notice, that's okay, Shaun will notice.]
21 INT. AMBULANCE (MOVING) -- DAY 21
Back with Shaun and the family and the EMT.
SHAUN
It changed.
The EMT looks to Shaun.
SHAUN (CONT'D)
The boy's heart rate changed.
The EMT looks to the monitor.
EMT
It's the same. 86 bpm.25.
Shaun studies the monitor. Closely. Stands in the cramped
area and gets right up to it.
SHAUN
It used to be higher.
EMT
No. It used to be 86; it's still 86.
SHAUN
It used to come up to here.
He points to the monitor where we see the familiar graph of
a heart rate. He indicates a slightly higher amplitude.
SHAUN (CONT'D)
Lower amplitude means lower voltage--
EMT
It looks exactly the same to me.
When people disagree with Shaun, he doesn't quite know how
to respond; he grows frustrated and anxious.
SHAUN
Lower amplitude means lower voltage.
His concern makes the parents concerned.
BONNIE
(to EMT)
What's going on? What does it mean?
EMT
(reassuring)
It means he's trying to read twenty
year old equipment while traveling
in a vehicle going forty miles an
hour. All your son's vitals are
stable. He's fine.
But Shaun continues to rack his brain and observe the patient,
trying to figure this mystery out.
SHAUN
His heart--
EMT
(suddenly)
Boo!
Shaun doesn't react, the parents do.26.
EMT (CONT'D)
Your heart rate changed.
(off Shaun's stoicism)
Or it would have--
(re parents)
Their's changed. Heart rates change;
it doesn't always mean anything.
But Shaun isn't assuaged.
22 INT. OPERATING ROOM #1 -- DAY 22
Melendez and his team (including Claire, Jared and Elle) are
operating on 104's heart which is open before us, beating.
It's going smoothly but Claire nervously watches the patient's
vital signs. Melendez takes note and--
MELENDEZ
He's unconscious; he's not going to
have a panic attack.
Claire remains vigilant.
CLAIRE
(quietly to Jared)
How did you get him to sign? Did you
threaten him?
JARED
Of course not.
(off her look)
I simply told him he was either
consenting or going home; then I
gave him the two forms and told him
to pick one.
MELENDEZ
(without looking up,
anticipating)
And you highlighted the section of
the Release Against Medical Advice
form that mentioned "possible
likelihood of death or permanent
disability".
Jared shrugs.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
Nicely done.
(then)
Give me forceps and a pick-up. I'm
isolating the descending aorta.
Instruments slap into Melendez's hand from efficient Nurses.
Elle anticipates his next move.27.
ELLE
Vascular clamp.
And a Nurse hands her what she needs. And--
CLAIRE
What's that?
Melendez gives her a look. She indicates something just away
from the surgical site--
CLAIRE (CONT'D)
Under the left atrium... something...
white... Is that part of the lung?
Melendez looks and sure enough there's a little something
white just peaking out from under the heart. That is odd.
Melendez uses his gloved hands to delicately lift and turn
the heart and is stunned to see--
MELENDEZ
(confused)
It's pus.
He racks his brain, trying to figure this out, then something
scary occurs to him--
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
Did he have TB?
ELLE
No, he doesn't have any--
MELENDEZ
(urgent)
Not currently! Does he have a history--
JARED
When he was a teenager, he was exposed
to--
MELENDEZ
He's got an abscess and it's about
to--
And the abscess literally bursts open before our eyes - blood
and pus sprays. ALARMS SOUND as the patient's blood pressure
crashes. And our team goes into emergency mode.
JARED
Suction and a lap sponge. His BP's
crashing.28.
ELLE
Two liters saline wide open.
MELENDEZ
Two units of packed red cells on a
bear hugger. Get levophed on board.
Titrate to systolic of 100. Get in
there with the suction. I can't see
a damn thing.
They all spring into action.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
(to Claire)
I hope it isn't too upsetting to him
when he hears he would have died in
his room if we'd waited another hour
to operate.
And Claire knows he's right. And the crisis continues.
NURSE
(entering)
Dr. Melendez, we've got an incoming
eight year old male, pneumothorax
stabilized but undetermined internal
injuries. Who would you like to catch?
MELENDEZ
Claire, don't think we need you in
here.
Claire is a bit surprised; the crisis does seem to be ongoing.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
This patient will be fine. ...Now.
And so she exits--
23 INT. E.R. -- DAY 23
The EMTs burst through the entry doors with the unconscious
boy and his parents and are met by Claire. Shaun struggles
to keep up as they move--
EMT
Eight year old healthy boy status
post encounter with shattered glass
sign. Numerous lacerations--
SHAUN
(agitated, excited)
Echo--29.
EMT
--Also status post tension pneumo
secondary to trauma treated at scene
by bystander.
CLAIRE
Get him set up in trauma three with
an EKG, full blood work, and a pan-
scan.
As the Nurse and Orderlies take the boy away [through a door
marked "Medical Personnel Only", Shaun becomes more agitated.
SHAUN
We need an echo-- echocardiogram.
CLAIRE
(to EMT)
Who is this?
EMT
He helped with first-aid at the
airport--
BONNIE
(no)
He saved his life.
SHAUN
I'm a doctor. He needs an
echocardiogram. Where are you taking
him?
CLAIRE
To surgery--
(checks chart)
All cardiac vital signs are within
normal range.
Shaun moves to follow the boy's gurney. SECURITY stops him.
CLAIRE (CONT'D)
Do you have any ID?
SHAUN
No.
Shaun looks toward where the boy went, frustrated.
SHAUN (CONT'D)
His heart.
CLAIRE
--Is fine.30.
She moves to go after the boy. Shaun tries to follow and is
again intercepted by Security. He resists.
SHAUN
(to Security)
Adam needs an echocardiogram.
CLAIRE
Behave yourself, or they'll have you
removed from the building.
And she leaves Shaun there. Shaun looks around to the waiting
room. People are looking back at him. Then, once again, he
moves quickly toward the restricted door and--
24 EXT. SAN JOSE ST. BONAVENTURE HOSPITAL -- MOMENTS LATER 24
Not overly surprisingly, the hospital doors open and Shaun
is forcibly removed by Security.
He stands there, looking back toward a Security Guard who is
now posted outside the door. Shaun feels his failure and
his impotence and starts to rock slightly.
FADE OUT:
END OF ACT TWO31.
ACT THREE
FADE IN:
25 INT. OPERATING ROOM #1 -- DAY 25
Melendez finishes his work on Callum who is now stable.
MELENDEZ
Dr. McLean, close him up. Nice work
everybody.
And as Elle (pleased for the opportunity) begins to stitch
up the gaping hole in the chest, Melendez heads for the door,
followed by Jared.
26 INT. PREP ROOM -- CONTINUOUS 26
Claire and a NURSE are waiting. The Nurse holds up an IPAD
displaying the CT scan for Melendez to review. As he does
so, he and Jared take off their bloody scrubs and begin
scrubbing for the next surgery.
MELENDEZ
Lacerations on the liver and spleen.
Hematoma around the internal jugular.
Otherwise stable. We'll put in a few
sutures, a few drains.
(then)
Have two units typed and crossed.
Unworried, Melendez heads into--
27 INT. OPERATING ROOM #2 -- CONTINUOUS 27
And he sees Adam, already sedated, on the table. But he's
surprised to also see that the boy's still hooked up to the
ad hoc one way valve. He stops.
MELENDEZ
What's that?
CLAIRE
A one way valve.
(off Melendez)
EMT reports that the boy suffered a
pneumothorax.
Claire watches as Melendez studies it; he's suitably
impressed.
MELENDEZ
Cool.
(MORE)32.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
(back to business)
We'll put in a chest tube when we
pull that contraption.
Claire considers, then...
CLAIRE
...Do you think we should do an
echocardiogram?
MELENDEZ
Based on the presenting symptoms and
vital signs and the results of the
CT scan, I'd say...
(looks at her,
challenging)
No. Am I missing something?
CLAIRE
No, sir.
MELENDEZ
(pointed; you want to
delay another surgery?)
Do you think we have time to--?
CLAIRE
No, sir.
MELENDEZ
(to Nurse)
Scalpel.
And as they cut into the boy--
28 EXT. HOSPITAL -- DAY 28
Meanwhile, Shaun is walking from door to door around the
exterior of the hospital.
- locked
- locked
- security stationed outside; he walks on
- locked
And he's back where he started. At the ER entrance and the
now familiar Security Guard.
He begins to rock, nervously muttering to himself,
unintelligibly.33.
Security and onlookers watch him cautiously.
And it begins to rain. And he stops rocking and goes very
still--
29 INT. CASPER MEDICAL CLINIC - FLASHBACK -- DAY 29
OPEN ON rain against a window--
Young Shaun is looking out at the rain, seemingly mesmerized.
Behind him, his brother speaks to a doctor; the rabbit is on
the examination table. Like Shaun, we're aware of them and
we hear all they're saying but we don't really see them.
CLINIC DOCTOR
We don't normally--
STEVE
I know. I'm sorry. This is the closest
doctor place and it was an emergency.
CLINIC DOCTOR
I can see that. Unfortunately...
even if I was a vet, the rabbit's
dead.
Steve, worried, looks over to Shaun and as if sensing that:
SHAUN
...Everything smells different when
it rains.
He of course betrays no emotion. The Clinic Doctor approaches
Shaun at the window, sympathetic, and it's only now that we
realize he is a slightly younger Dr. Glassman.
DR. GLASSMAN
I'm sorry.
SHAUN
What do we do now?
DR. GLASSMAN
You should bury him. You should give
him a nice funeral.
SHAUN
No.
(then)
What do we do now to help him?
Dr. Glassman is slightly confused by the question.34.
DR. GLASSMAN
I'm afraid it's too late to do
anything.
SHAUN
Has he gone to heaven?
DR. GLASSMAN
I hope so. I'm sure he deserved to.
SHAUN
I don't want him to go to heaven. I
want him to be here.
Steve steps over and takes his brother's hand.
STEVE
This won't happen again.
SHAUN
It can't happen again. He's dead.
STEVE
No. I mean... Nothing like this is
ever going to happen to us, ever
again.
SHAUN
You don't know the future.
STEVE
I do.
Finally Young Shaun turns to face his brother.
STEVE (CONT'D)
Nothing like this is ever going to
happen to us ever again... Because
we're not going home. We're never
going home again. We've got each
other. That's all we need.
Dr. Glassman watches, concerned and yet moved--
30 INT. LECTURE HALL -- DAY 30
And we return to Dr. Glassman, equally thoughtful. We stay
on Glassman as Andrews makes his argument.
ANDREWS
Where is he? If we can't trust this
man to show up for a job interview,
how can we trust him with life and
death judgments?
(MORE)35.
ANDREWS (CONT'D)
Are you going to tell us that there
were no equally qualified surgeons;
surgeons without this one's... issues?
GLASSMAN
...No.
The others are surprised by this admission.
GLASSMAN (CONT'D)
Which is exactly why we should hire
this one.
(explains, passionate)
We are judged as people based on how
we treat people. Most importantly,
how we treat people who do not have
the advantages we have. We will be a
better hospital for hiring him. And
we will be better people for hiring
him. And we will give hope to many
people that their limits aren't what
they think they are.
Most of the room is touched. Preston is proud of Glassman -
this is exactly what she wanted from him. Even Alexis is
sympathetic. So she hates to be the one to point out that...
ALEXIS
Implicit in what you're saying is...
Shaun has limits. You spoke of his
strengths, what of his weaknesses?
Glassman takes a beat; would rather not have to discuss this--
ALEXIS (CONT'D)
A surgeon, as you know better than
any of us, isn't just a mechanic
fixing parts. A surgeon manages a
team. A team that has to trust him;
a team he has to inspire. And
patients; he needs to inspire them
too. He needs to communicate; not
just information but sympathy,
empathy. Can Dr. Murphy do that? Can
he do that under stress? Can he do
that knowing that a human life
literally hangs in the balance?
And we know Glassman is going to do his best to defend Shaun.
But what we will see is--
31 EXT. HOSPITAL -- DAY 31
Shaun continues to rock, alone, in the rain--36.
32 INT. OPERATING ROOM #2 -- DAY 32
Melendez and his team (now including Elle) are operating on
the boy. Both the neck and stomach are open. Melendez works
the abdomen and keeps a close eye on the neck where Jared
and Claire are operating.
MELENDEZ
Careful to inspect the recurrent
laryngeal. It's often damaged in
cervical trauma.
(then)
Sponge on a stick.
The instrument slaps Melendez's hand as he glances up at the
monitors, then continues his work. Then he stops. Looks back
up.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
What was his heart rate five minutes
ago?
JARED
Eighty-six.
Melendez looks back to the monitor; it says 86, but something
bothers him.
MELENDEZ
You sure?
JARED
Certain. He's been a rock; it's barely
changed.
MELENDEZ
Something changed. Something is
different.
He stares at the monitor but can't quite place it. He shrugs
and goes back to work.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
Irrigation... right over the splenic
artery... Suction.
Then he stops again.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
(to Claire)
Why did you ask about an echo?
(off her uncertainty)
You had no medical reason, but you
asked anyway. Why?37.
CLAIRE
There was this weird guy, he's the
one who did the one way valve, he
kept insisting that the boy needed
an echocardiogram.
MELENDEZ
Did he say why?
CLAIRE
(no)
He was really... weird.
Melendez thinks about that. But not for too long because a
monitor starts to buzz--
ELLE
His hematocrit is dropping.
(then)
That makes no sense. He's not bleeding
anymore. Everything's under control.
Everyone is stumped. Finally--
MELENDEZ
Do an echo.
The others are surprised--
JARED
Sir, the boy is open, we'd have to
sterilize the equipment; it's gonna
take awhile.
MELENDEZ
Good. That'll give me time to find
out why the hell we're doing an echo.
(then)
Dr. Browne, come with me. We're going
to find your weird guy.
And he hurries out. Claire's thrown for a beat, but she
follows--
33 INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAYS/E.R. -- MOMENTS LATER 33
Still in their bloody scrubs, Claire and Melendez hurry
through the halls; their dialogue is as fast paced as their
actual pace--
MELENDEZ
So about that psych consult--
CLAIRE
Seriously?38.
MELENDEZ
I want to hear it.
CLAIRE
Your ego needs confirmation that I
was wrong?
MELENDEZ
Obviously you were wrong; I want to
hear you say you were wrong.
CLAIRE
When was the last time you said I
was right?
MELENDEZ
No one learns squat from being right.
CLAIRE
You're unbelievable. How can somebody
who must have spent their whole life
listening to people tell them how
smart he is, how good looking is, be
so damn insecure?
MELENDEZ
(same tone)
You think I'm good looking?
CLAIRE
No.
MELENDEZ
And I suppose you weren't wrong about
the psych consult either?
CLAIRE
A patient's state of mind matters.
MELENDEZ
My job is to teach you. If you're
not learning, I'm not doing my job.
And as far as I can tell right now,
I'm not doing my job. You drinking
again?
CLAIRE
As often as I can. When I'm not on
call. You know, whenever I get a
chance to not have you ruin my day.
There is clearly antagonism between these two. And just as
clearly, there is chemistry.39.
They arrive at the crowded E.R. where Claire met Shaun, filled
with medical personnel and the detritus of society awaiting
help. They look around.
MELENDEZ
Which one is he? They all look weird.
CLAIRE
I don't see him.
But then she sees the Security Guard--
34 EXT. HOSPITAL -- MOMENTS LATER 34
Shaun still stands in the plaza, alone in the rain.
And then REVEAL Claire and Melendez approaching--
MELENDEZ
Why the echo?
Shaun is confused; who is this man?
CLAIRE
This is Dr. Melendez. The boy you
brought in, the boy you said needed
an echocardiogram.
SHAUN
For his heart.
MELENDEZ
(curt)
Obviously for his heart; that's what
echocardiograms are for. Why?
As we are starting to learn, Shaun doesn't react well to
pressure focused on him (or questions of any sort for that
matter). He struggles to figure out how to respond. Claire
steps in.
CLAIRE
(calm)
I understand you think he needs an
echocardiogram. I don't know why.
SHAUN
I noticed there was a slight reduction
in the intensity of the
electrocardiogram.
MELENDEZ
(to Claire, annoyed)
Why would he answer you, but not--40.
CLAIRE
I didn't ask him anything; I didn't
expect--
MELENDEZ
How did you know that would make a--
(doesn't matter, back
to business)
The electrical flow; that's what I
noticed too; the heart rate was the
same but the amplitude dropped.
SHAUN
Yes. Pericardial effusion.
MELENDEZ
Yes. Reduced cardiac output would
stress other organs, they'd start to
shut down--
His phone rings. He quickly answers it.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
We'll be right back up.
A beat as he listens, then hangs up. His mood has changed.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
They did the echo. It's normal. No
pericardial effusion.
He turns to go. Shaun gets agitated.
SHAUN
There has to be. What other
explanation is there? Which means
the echo can't be normal.
Melendez turns on him--
MELENDEZ
You're smart kid. But you're not
smarter than a lab result. Which
means the echo is normal which means
we just wasted our time.
And he hurries back in. Leaving Claire and Shaun behind.
Claire is about to follow but then looks to Shaun, considers
and--
CLAIRE
Come with me.41.
And she heads back toward the building; Shaun following--
FADE OUT:
END OF ACT THREE42.
ACT FOUR
FADE IN:
35 INT. SCRUB ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 35
Melendez is scrubbing back in (O.R.#2 is visible through
windows in the doors and wall) when Claire enters with Shaun.
Melendez isn't overly surprised that she's taken in another
stray.
MELENDEZ
(calling to Jared)
Show them.
Jared brings up the results of the echocardiogram on a
monitor. It runs through. And sure enough it looks normal.
SHAUN
Again.
Jared looks to Melendez who just shrugs. Jared plays it again.
Shaun watches even more intently.
SHAUN (CONT'D)
Again.
POP-UP - VARIOUS SHOTS of other ECHOS that Shaun has seen
quickly cycle through his memory; he's apparently comparing
them to what he's being presented with.
And again it's played. Shaun moves closer still. Suddenly--
SHAUN (CONT'D)
There.
The image is frozen and Jared and Claire look to where Shaun
indicates.
JARED
It looks normal to me.
SHAUN
There's a concave deformity in the
right atrium.
JARED
No there isn't.
SHAUN
Yes there is. It's very subtle. Blood
must be pushing--43.
JARED
How many right atriums have you seen?
How many echos have you reviewed?
SHAUN
Six.
MELENDEZ
Oh. I've seen approximately a thousand
more than that. And even if you're
right, that's not where a pericardial
effusion manifests.
CLAIRE
Not usually.
(off Melendez)
But it could. This kid was sprayed
with glass shards; cut his jugular;
what if a piece of glass entered his
blood stream?
Melendez doesn't stop her.
CLAIRE (CONT'D)
It could have traveled down from the
jugular vein, into the brachiocephalic
vein and on to the superior vena
cava. If it punctured the SVC, blood
could be leaking behind the heart,
restricting the heart's ability to
expand and fill during diastole.
Reducing the heart's efficiency.
JARED
Lot of ifs there.
But Claire doesn't care about Jared's view. She just keeps
looking at Melendez. Melendez considers for a long beat,
then heads into--
36 INT. OPERATING ROOM #2 -- CONTINUOUS 36
Elle is at the boy's side, keeping him stable as Melendez
enters; the other doctors behind him--
MELENDEZ
Dr. McLean, please insert a ten gauge
needle into the retro-cardiac space
and draw out whatever you find there.
JARED
If Claire's wrong, we could set off
an arrhythmia; could kill the boy.44.
MELENDEZ
And if she's right, we're going to
pull blood out and then hopefully
save this kid.
Elle swallows her nerves and--
ELLE
Ten gauge on a syringe.
She is handed a scary looking long needle.
ELLE (CONT'D)
Betadyne over the mid clavicular
line.
The Nurse swabs the target area which appears to be almost
right over the boy's heart (but is just fractionally under
it).
Elle then carefully inserts the needle. It seems to go in
forever.
Finally, she stops. And pulls back on the plunger. And we
see... red. Blood. Claire and Shaun were right. A moment of
relief.
MELENDEZ
Excellent. We know what's wrong.
Question is, can we fix it?
And they get to work--
37 INT. LECTURE HALL -- DAY 37
The Board has reconvened.
ANDREWS
We've waited long enough; we've talked
long enough, it's time for a vote.
Glassman looks to Alexis.
ALEXIS
I'm sorry. He's right.
(then)
Show of hands: all in favor of
ratifying Dr. Glassman's decision to
hire Dr. Shaun Murphy?
Glassman's hand goes up. So does Preston's. And perhaps
surprisingly, so does Alexis'. A smattering of others but
things don't look good.45.
ALEXIS (CONT'D)
All against.
Many more hands go up; Andrews allows himself a smile of
relief. Glassman is quietly devastated. But then, an assistant
enters the room--
ASSISTANT
Excuse me.
GLASSMAN
(suddenly concerned)
Is there a medical emergency? Who's
needed?
ASSISTANT
No. No medical emergency--
ANDREWS
--Then you weren't supposed to--
ASSISTANT
I know but... You should go online.
PRESTON
What? To what site?
ASSISTANT
Pretty much any of them. YouTube,
Twitter, any of the local news sites.
And they of course all have phones or iPads with them.
Everyone goes on line and we SEE GLIMPSES of news reports or
simply uploaded videos of...
38 INT. AIRPORT - ACCIDENT SCENE - VIDEO SNIPETS -- DAY 38
Sean cutting into the boy.
SHAUN
Incision should take place two ribs
down.
Shaun feeds the tube in through the incision.
DOCTOR
(then, excited)
His right chest is rising.
(takes a moment to
confirm)
He's breathing!
(even the doctor is
amazed)
You saved his life.46.
The crowd cheers.
The parents are relieved and grateful and hug a rather awkward
Shaun.
Shaun, almost confused by the outpouring of love.
39 INT. LECTURE HALL -- CONTINUOUS 39
ASSISTANT
The YouTube clip already has over
two hundred thousand views. It's
apparently one of our doctors.
ALEXIS
(amazed)
Shaun Murphy saved this boy?
ASSISTANT
The boy is in surgery. Dr. Melendez
isn't sure if he's going to make it.
And with that Glassman heads for the exit--
40 INT. OPERATING ROOM #2 -- DAY 40
The patient lies on the table. His chest open. His little
heart no longer beating as the bypass machine does the work
for his heart and lungs.
Our team quietly and intensely do their work. Any mistake
could mean death.
MELENDEZ
Retractor.
A Retractor hits his hand.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
Pesky right lobe keeps trying to
sneak into my operating field.
(then)
Brow.
A Nurse dabs his brow. Melendez looks up to the gallery and
sees--
Glassman and Preston are watching.
41 INT. GALLERY -- CONTINUOUS 41
Overlooking the surgery. Glassman watches like a classical
music buff would watch Beethoven composing. Preston is a
step back, her eyes usually averted, surgery makes her queasy.47.
GLASSMAN
Your fiancee is a pleasure to watch
work.
PRESTON
(not really watching)
Yeah.
GLASSMAN
The best surgeon I've seen in thirty
years.
He watches a beat longer before...
GLASSMAN (CONT'D)
You're the youngest member of the
Board.
PRESTON
I'm well aware.
GLASSMAN
And everyone else is well aware of
why you're there.
PRESTON
(bit defensive)
My grandfather founded this hospital
But I more than earn my keep in there.
GLASSMAN
I agree. But not everyone else does.
And the protection of your legacy
will only last so long.
(off her look)
You were sarcastic to Andrews earlier,
mocked him. He's not going to forget
that.
PRESTON
I was helping you.
GLASSMAN
If I'm going to lose, I'd rather not
drag you down with me.
PRESTON
...You think you're going to lose?
GLASSMAN
Eventually. Everybody loses
eventually.
She takes that in, considers...48.
PRESTON
Is that your guy?
And only then does Glassman (or we) notice:
42 INT. OPERATING ROOM #2 -- CONTINUOUS 42
Shaun is the O.R.; gowned, but no mask or cap because he's
in the back, almost in a corner. He's not taking part but he
is finally here. He's watching attentively, taking every
single thing in:
43 EXT. BUS - FLASHBACK -- DAY 43
The bus Shaun stopped in front of in the opening. It's a few
years earlier and, as we will soon see, it has recently begun
being used as a home.
YOUNG SHAUN
Did you steal this?
44 INT. BUS - FLASHBACK -- DAY 44
Two cots, an old microwave, mismatched plates and a lot of
books make this bus a home. Young Steve present Young Shaun
with dinner: microwaved mac and cheese.
STEVE
No. Jeff from the grocery store gave
it to me.
YOUNG SHAUN
Can we get a TV?
STEVE
No.
YOUNG SHAUN
Why not?
STEVE
Because we're poor.
Young Shaun begins to eat.
YOUNG SHAUN
Do you think mom is looking for us?
STEVE
No.
Shaun doesn't look up, but he does pause his eating for a
moment. Steve senses Shaun needs more of an answer.49.
YOUNG SHAUN
If she was looking for us, she would
have told the cops or someone and
they'd have come to our school and
gotten us.
(then)
She loves us but she knows it's better
this way.
Shaun goes back to eating.
STEVE
I got you a present.
Shaun keeps eating.
SHAUN
It's not my birthday.
STEVE
I got you a present anyway.
Shaun stops eating. Steve hands Shaun a hand-wrapped present.
Shaun opens it. It's a box containing a number of small items;
some new, some found: a calculator, a fireman's hat, a hard
hat, a hammer and... that toy scalpel we saw Shaun cherish,
now clean and new. He takes the scalpel, holds it...
STEVE (CONT'D)
Never forget... You're the smart
one. You can do anything.
Then Steve affectionately musses his brother's hair.
45 INT. OPERATING ROOM #2 -- DAY 45
We notice that the toy scalpel is now in Shaun's hand. He
reaches up and almost unconsciously musses his own hair.
Then he looks to the surgery, closes his eyes, holds up his
hands... And as the CAMERA spins around him we see him and
the room transformed.
46 INT. OPERATING ROOM #2 - SHAUN'S IMAGINATION -- DAY 46
The room is actually the same except for the fact that the
only doctor there is Shaun. He's the surgeon. And he performs
the procedure in this imaginary world. And we--
INTERCUT:
Between Shaun and Melendez, both performing the same delicate
surgery, one in the real world, one in his imagination, almost
in unison.50.
The other doctors certainly notice Shaun and what seems almost
like a dance. But nobody stops him, they remain focused on
their own tasks.
WE SPIN ABOUT both Melendez and Shaun. Melendez is like a
concert pianist at work; his hands moving quickly and
gracefully; we take in the blood, the sutures, the exposed
human heart, so vulnerable. The miraculousness of what is
happening is not lost on anyone in the room.
FADE OUT:
END OF ACT FOUR51.
ACT FIVE
FADE IN:
47 INT. OPERATING ROOM #2 -- DAY 47
The surgery continues.
MELENDEZ
Dr. Browne...
She moves in closer.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
Nurse, pick-ups.
She hands what are basically medical tweezers to him and he
reaches into the heart and pulls out...
A TINY PIECE OF GLASS. This little thing is the source of
all this damage.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
(to Claire)
You were right.
A big moment between the two of them. (As Preston watches.)
But it lasts but a moment and they go back to the work of
saving this boy's life...
48 INT. WAITING AREA -- DAY 48
The parents wait nervously. And wait. Until finally...
Dr. Melendez enters the room, looking exhausted and bloody,
and he tells the mother and father... the good news.
We experience this M.O.S. No words are needed to communicate
their joy and relief and gratitude...
49 INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA -- DAY 49
Glassman, a tray of food in front of him, is at the cashier,
paying. Shaun stands at his side. Glassman has spoken
eloquently about Shaun's abilities, but he treats him a little
like a child, a little over-protective - perhaps much the
same as a parent would.
GLASSMAN
(proud)
You saved that boy.52.
SHAUN
(more fact)
I know. His name is Adam. I'm hungry.
GLASSMAN
(used to the non-
sequiturs)
Yes. That's why I'm getting you a
sandwich.
SHAUN
I don't like pickles.
GLASSMAN
I know. I told them.
SHAUN
I don't--
GLASSMAN
And I checked.
That's enough for Shaun. They head for a table.
GLASSMAN (CONT'D)
The Board will be reconvening in 45
minutes. I have some business to
take care of. Can you stay here until
then?
SHAUN
Yes. I think so. I'll try.
Shaun sits down. Melendez places the tray in front of him,
then places an assuring hand on Shaun's shoulder and for
once Shaun does not draw back from human contact.
GLASSMAN
That's all I can ask.
Then Glassman heads off--
50 INT. MELENDEZ'S OFFICE -- DAY 50
Well organized, if a bit austere. Only one or two personal
touches: a photo of him with his fiancee, another of a much
younger version of him with his parents and sister, and a
Rubik's Cube.
Glassman is slightly anxiously waiting. After a beat, Melendez
enters and anticipates the issue--
MELENDEZ
He's autistic, isn't he?53.
GLASSMAN
Yes.
MELENDEZ
(reacts)
All the more impressive.
GLASSMAN
The Board's about to reconvene. I'd
like you to vouch for him.
(then)
Given your reputation and seeing as
you're the one he'll be working for,
I think it'll make a big difference.
MELENDEZ
...No.
(off Glassman's
surprise)
There's a difference between knowledge
and judgment; and you can't be a
good surgeon without both. Dr. Murphy
has the character of a child; how
can he possibly be trusted with life
and death decisions?
GLASSMAN
Shaun made one today and a child is
alive because of it.
MELENDEZ
True. But the next one may be dead
because of it.
GLASSMAN
I remember when I first hired you.
You weren't exactly making the most
adult decisions yourself.
MELENDEZ
Also true. But there's a cure for
youth and stupidity: time and
experience. There are treatments for
autism, but there is no cure.
GLASSMAN
(this is personal)
Please. ...I need your help on this
one.
MELENDEZ
Why? What's the story with this kid?
Why is this so personal to you?54.
GLASSMAN
(beat, then)
I let him down once.
And that's all he's willing to share.
MELENDEZ
(concerned for a friend)
In this job, letting things get
personal is a sure formula for
screwing things up.
GLASSMAN
(considers, then)
...No. Letting things get personal
is how we make things matter. How we
give things meaning.
Melendez considers that. But...
MELENDEZ
I'm sorry. I can't tell them something
I don't believe.
Glassman nods, accepting that decision and exits, passing
Preston who has been waiting just outside, clearly she has
heard the end of the conversation.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
So are you proud of me? Or are you
disappointed?
PRESTON
Do I have to pick just one?
Melendez approaches her and gives her a kiss.
MELENDEZ
(curious)
Tell me... watching me operate, do
you get turned on?
PRESTON
(amused by and used
to his arrogance)
A little. Not as much as Glassman
does.
He laughs, knows it's kind of true. He's pleased and
comfortable with her. And as they walk away--
PRESTON (CONT'D)
You got time for dinner tonight or
you got more lives to save?55.
MELENDEZ
I've sent the scrubs and the cape in
for dry cleaning. I'm all yours.
51 INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA -- DAY 51
Shaun eats alone, waiting for Glassman to come get him.
Claire approaches and sits across from him. He doesn't make
much eye contact.
CLAIRE
You're new to town, right?
SHAUN
I'm from Casper, Wyoming. I live in
a bus. But if I stay here, the
hospital will give me an apartment.
CLAIRE
...Great. I'm sure you have a lot of
questions.
SHAUN
No.
CLAIRE
You must be curious about the place,
about the people. I can give you the
lowdown.
SHAUN
Dr. Glassman gave me a map of the
hospital. And I got a map of San
Jose online.
And, to Claire's surprise, that's the end of that.
CLAIRE
Okay. Great.
And she gets up to walk away. But before she gets too far:
SHAUN
(same tone, as if
she's still right
there)
I do have one question.
She turns back but doesn't sit back down. And for the first
time with her, he actually makes and maintains eye contact.56.
SHAUN (CONT'D)
Why were you rude to me when we first
met, then nicer to me the second
time we met and now you want to help
me? Which time were you pretending?
It's not an accusation. He seems genuinely curious. She
doesn't have an answer, feels her own hypocrisy.
And then she's saved from having to answer by the arrival of
Glassman--
GLASSMAN
Shaun; it's time.
Shaun quickly gets up and leaves with Glassman--
Claire turns and walks the other away. She notices Jared
standing near the cafeteria entrance, watching her, and she
heads toward him.
CLAIRE
(without stopping)
What are you doing tonight?
JARED
I don't know.
CLAIRE
Good. I'll see you.
And her message is quite clear, as is the answer ("yes, you
will"), even as she walks past him and out.
52 INT. LECTURE HALL -- DAY 52
The hearing has reconvened. Shaun sits quietly in the front
row and barely reacts to anything said about him, neither
the good nor the bad.
ANDREWS
The vote was clear; why are we re-
opening this? Is it really because
of a piece of publicity?
PRESTON
It's because the man saved someone's
life.
ANDREWS
And thank God for that. But it doesn't
change a single thing we discussed.57.
PRESTON
It proves he's more than a capable
doctor!
ANDREWS
He has a serious deficit!
GLASSMAN
Give him six months.
ANDREWS
No. The reason we voted against him
is because we think the risks of
having him here, for a day nevermind
six months, are--
GLASSMAN
--If he screws up, Shaun will be
immediately dismissed. And... I will
resign my position as President of
the hospital.
Everyone reacts. Jessica is disappointed; he's definitely
overplayed his hand.
PRESTON
I don't know that it's necessary for--
Alexis cuts her off - the offer is on the table; Alexis is
going to make sure it stays there.
ALEXIS
We haven't heard from Dr. Murphy.
Perhaps we should hear from him before
we decide his fate.
GLASSMAN
Shaun...
Glassman gestures for Shaun to step forward. Shaun does so.
ALEXIS
Dr. Murphy... Shaun... I'd like you
to tell us why you want to become a
surgeon.
All eyes are on him. His entire future rides on the next few
moments. He takes it all in and considers the question. He
doesn't answer for a long time. And--
53 INT. BUS - FLASHBACK -- DAY 53
The place is a little more lived in than we last saw. But we
OPEN CLOSE ON Young Shaun, quietly reading at a salvaged
desk.58.
Suddenly the book is closed by his brother--
STEVE
Time to go play.
YOUNG SHAUN
I'm reading.
STEVE
Time to make friends.
YOUNG SHAUN
You're my friend.
STEVE
Yes. I know you. And I like you.
It's time you let other kids know
you too. So they'll like you too.
Young Shaun considers, then gets up--
54 EXT./INT. OLD BUILDING - FLASHBACK -- DAY 54
A fence surrounds an abandoned building. [It's not the only
one in the neighborhood; it's not exactly an economically
booming town.]
WE FIND Shaun and Steve crawling through an opening in the
fence with a group of neighborhood kids (some of them the
very same kids we saw beating Shaun up).
We see them playing games. Tag. Hide and Seek. And yes, they
are having fun. Even Shaun. He's not laughing or even really
smiling. But his eyes show the joy. Which thrills his brother.
And now Shaun and Steve are alone, hiding from the other
boys in the basement of the building.
STEVE
Told ya. Fun, right--
YOUNG SHAUN
(you'll give us away)
Shhh.
And then there's a rumble. Something is wrong. Shaun and
Steve make eye contact. And then a support beam falls. And
then...
CLOSE ON Shaun's face--
55 INT. LECTURE HALL -- DAY 55
CLOSE ON that same face--59.
And just when the Board is starting to think he is just not
capable of delivering an answer, Shaun speaks.
SHAUN
...The day that the rain smelled
like ice cream, my bunny went to
heaven in front of my eyes. The day
the copper pipes in the old building
smelled like burnt food... my brother
went to heaven in front of my eyes.
(slight beat)
Neither one had a chance to become
an adult. I wanted to let them become
adults. I wanted them to have kids
of their own, and love those kids. I
wanted that for them more than
anything.
(slight beat)
And I want to make a lot of money.
So I can have a TV. And so I can
help kids like me.
There is silence in the room. Everyone is moved (though it's
unclear if they are swayed). Glassman nods to Shaun that
he's done well.
And then Alexis, the Chairman of the Hospital Board, stands,
walks up to Shaun, shakes his hand and...
ALEXIS
Dr. Murphy, I want to be the first
to welcome you to the staff of San
Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital. We're
proud to have you.
And then there's an enthusiastic round of applause.
Andrews is actually quite pleased with this outcome (though
perhaps he doesn't clap as enthusiastically as the others).
Preston is happy for Glassman but very worried where this
will lead.
Glassman is simply thrilled and hugs Shaun.
Shaun betrays no emotion.
GLASSMAN
By the way, I just got a text.
Melendez's team is going into surgery.
(holds him at arm's
length)
I mean if you're interested.
Shaun shows no excitement, but turns and leaves.60.
56 INT. OPERATING ROOM #1 -- DAY 56
Melendez and his team are mid-surgery. Shaun, scrubbed and
gowned, stands nearby.
MELENDEZ
Got a messy field here.
Jared moves to assist--
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
No.
(then)
Murphy.
Shaun hesitates for only a moment. He steps forward, puts
out his hand and--
SHAUN
Suction.
A NURSE slaps the necessary equipment into his hand. And he
does his job. He is now a surgeon. And as Shaun does his
work:
MELENDEZ
I'm sure you've watched many of these.
And judging from your "dance" I'm
sure you've imagined even more. But
now it's actually happening. I
remember my first. I thought it
doesn't get any better than this.
And for you, I'm afraid, that's
literally true.
Claire reacts - what's going on? Melendez continues - calm
and rational.
MELENDEZ (CONT'D)
You're a nice kid and you're obviously
very smart, but you shouldn't be
here. So for as long as you're part
of my team, this is all you're going
to be doing: suction. I'm not going
to let you and Glassman screw this
up.
Shaun finishes. He watches Melendez work, seemingly unaffected
by what has just been said.
SHAUN
I saw a lot of surgeons in medical
school. You're much better than them.
I have a lot to learn from you.61.
This is not kissing ass. This is simply true.
SHAUN (CONT'D)
You're very arrogant. Do you think
that helps you be a good surgeon?
Does it hurt you as a person? Is it
worth it?
Claire and the other doctors and nurses react - can't believe
the nerve of this guy. But of course, Shaun is genuinely
asking, genuinely curious.
Melendez pauses. But doesn't look up. Then he resumes his
work.
And we PULL UP AND AWAY from the surgery and the promise and
unknown of the future, and we:
FADE OUT:
END OF ACT FIVE
